I wake to the blazing solar rays streaming through the windows of my
room, directly brightening my closed eyes. I rub my eyes, wondering what
had gotten into them this morning, and that is when my mind conjured up
images of the President's speech yesterday. In his crisp white shirt
and matching pants, the colour that denotes the dimensional
representatives in the Royal governing council, he walked to the podium
and announced, "As I address this wonderful gathering, I am humbled to
inform you that after our tremendous efforts, the approval for extra
solar energy was sent by the Royal 10+1 dimensional governing council.
Henceforth, the sunless hours are minimised from 8 hours a day to 6
hours a day. The enhanced 2 hours of solar energy are expected to
increase energy production to 10²⁶ W by the end of this year, which will
earn our earth, the most wonderful of all 3+1 dimensional worlds, the
status of Type II level civilisation", which was followed by thunderous
applause. I just don't understand the craze these people have on
walking up the Kardesev scale. Don't we have enough already?!

Cursing my luck at not being born in the era when sunless hours were as
long as almost 12 hours, I stand in front of the UV washer that kills
all the pathogens sticking to my body and regulates my body temperature.
I remember my grandpa telling me stories about how, long ago, people
used to do something called bathing and brushing using water. That story
fascinates me the most because it is hard to believe that such a vital
and precious substance was used for such mundane acts! And the idea that
it used to cover almost three-fourths of the earth was unbelievable!

I dress up in my standard blue shirt and pants, the attire denoting my
job as a 'properties trainer'. My grandpa told me that back then,
people who did my job were called 'professors', a term I like more
than mere 'properties trainer'. As I appear at the door, I take the 2
chips that are required to be incorporated by every dimensioner every
morning, failing which, the dimensioner is punished by the denial of any
more afterlives. One chip does the job of connecting all our minds and
the functioning of our bodies to the galactic server, which is
maintained by the Royal 10+1 dimensioners. It analyses and transfers all
our thoughts and actions, and I used to add data to the mind-blowing
calculations that determine everything from recruitment to population
ratio. The second chip releases nutrients whenever required inside our
bodies, and is decided by the galactic server.

I hop on my 'Elastica', a location transporter provided for all
working citizens by the 4+1 dimensioners. It is incredible that time
stops while using the Elastica, it enables me to appear at my office on
another corner of earth at the exact same time as I gear up the
transporter. As my day starts, students of 3+1 fill in. This is my
favourite and most comfortable class because having been born in 3+1
dimensions myself, it is easier for my brain to 'process' the
properties of this dimension and train them efficiently. Except for the
special permissions given to some professionals like programmers,
researchers or teachers, it is a crime to know about the properties of
other dimensions. I sometimes feel sorry for one-dimensional students as
they can never witness the amazing phenomenon of rotations and
angularities, or how a 3+1 dimensional student can struggle with
relationships, which are much more natural to 5+1 dimensional students
since they know how to measure and harness emotions.

As my class with the 3+1 dimensioners is completed, I head for the
general meeting. Today's meeting is about the pending confirmation of
the recent rumour about my colleague. As I enter, I see the huge screen
with direct communication from the GS(Galactic Server), screening the
words "Rumour confirmed." I sit in my allotted seat, while the
governing general of this training depot swallows the microchip that
enables his voice box to produce the required frequency that can be
heard across the auditorium. He starts, "Mr.Ja\_3+1 is found guilty of
possessing the sense of curiosity which made him seek knowledge about
the workings of our Royal 10+1 dimensioners. Henceforth, he is removed
from his position, his privileges are revoked, and he will be sent to
Askaban for the removal of this dangerous sense."

A collective gasp escapes the room as the news sinks in. Askaban is a
massive black hole, an inescapable prison under the 10+1 dimensioners,
where your memories are altered, and senses are added or removed,
without putting you through the process of the next life. It is common
knowledge that people experience an alien sense called pain during their
stay in Askaban, which is more feared than the process of next life
itself. As we disperse, I receive a mail in my 'brain', assigning me
the classes which were previously handled by Mr.Ja\_3+1.

The rest of the day went with providing the students with the newly
arrived chips, which should be incorporated into their brains. This
enables them to work 18 hours a day as per the new norm. I even noticed
green workers excavating and planting new, upgraded plants which are
programmed to have enhanced production of 18 hours of solar power a day.
As I hop back on my Elastica, I remove the chips at my door, and in the
silence of my room, I conjure up the picture of the earth as described
by my grandpa--- with its blue ocean full of precious water, with green
fields that grow by themselves without programming, and clouds that form
on their own and move around. I enter my room, and with that blue ball
in my mind, I finally rest in my abode, just in time for my programmed
sleep to take over my metallic mind\...
