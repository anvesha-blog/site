excerpt: Is Karnataka's upholding of the hijab ban in educational institutes something to dismiss, or should we at IISER be talking about it?

In January 2022, hijab-clad Muslim students of a junior college in Karnataka were denied entry to the college on the grounds that it was a violation of the college's uniform policy. In the weeks that followed, protests occurred both in support of, and against, the students. Other educational institutes began to follow suit and prevented students wearing hijabs from entering their premises. Many petitions were filed on behalf of the Muslim students, however, on 15th March 2022, the Karnataka High Court upheld the hijab ban citing that hijab was not an essential religious practice.

This might make one wonder about many things. Why was the hijab ban enforced in the middle of the term, with exams around the corner and with no prior notice? Why did some colleges' rule books allow hijabs that matched the uniforms, yet these same colleges went ahead with the hijab ban? Why were teachers forced to remove their hijabs if the issue was only about student uniforms? What caused so many of these students' non-Muslim peers to suddenly turn hostile and protest against them in a hateful manner? Why were the Muslim students and their parents dealt with in humiliating ways? If the ban was about keeping religion out of educational institutions then why not ban symbols and practices of other religions? And if indeed the hijab is not an essential religious practice, then why ban it? And so on.

All of these questions aside, we at Exhibit A felt that this incident set a dangerous precedent by denying students their right to education on the basis of their religion. Following this, we decided to ask people at IISER TVM for their opinions on the hijab ban. Only 20% of the total people who responded were Muslim and only 30% were female.

Majority of them opined that the ban is unconstitutional and politically motivated, and they expressed solidarity with the Muslim students of Karnataka. Some saw the ban as a blatant act of Islamophobia and expressed concern about the government's and judiciary's apparent complicity in the country's rising levels of discrimination against Muslims. Hijab-wearing Muslim students claimed that wearing the hijab is both their right and a part of their identity and they don't see how the ban will promote equality. A couple of students stated that this topic should not be seen through the prism of religion and that education and religion should be kept apart. They explained that educational institutions have the right to establish rules governing the behaviour of individuals who belong to them, and that no individual has the authority to impose personal interests on these norms, hence the hijab ban is valid and does not violate Muslim girls' rights. Another student argued that citing uniform code violation is a flimsy excuse for the hijab ban and it is yet another attempt to police what women wear, adding that modesty standards vary from person to person and region to region, and that asking someone who regularly wears a hijab or other head covering to remove it is the same as asking them to remove any other piece of clothing. She also noted that, while the IISER code of conduct currently declares discrimination/harassment on any basis to be forbidden, students' lived experiences may differ, and the SAC should evaluate the guidelines, add detail, and make it clear what consequences will be faced. Another point raised by some students was that despite their opposition to the hijab ban, they found the hijab to be patriarchal and oppressive and hard to support.

It is true, the hijab has been used as a patriarchal tool in countless instances for a long time. However, because of differing interpretations of the religion's teachings, differences in culture and a variety of other reasons, the question of why people wear hijabs or head coverings and determining if the hijab is fundamentally patriarchal would require a separate article of its own. But, as Muslim activist, writer and architect Sara Ather asks, “Can clothing (considering their evolution in history) of women ever be divorced from the male gaze? If not, then the whole exercise of reclaiming clothing from patriarchy is essentially an exercise in redefining what a certain kind of clothing means to the wearer and only to the wearer. Since the hijab as a piece of clothing has been the sole property of Muslim women, then naturally, the reshaping of its perspective will only be valid when Muslim women do it themselves. While you think your fight is against certain symbols of patriarchy, you are actually reinforcing those symbols while saying that hijab can never be divorced from how a man defined it.” Shouldn't it then be that Muslim women who get to choose the meaning, nature, and necessity of the hijab, as well as determining if it is patriarchal?

It seemed interesting to me that the people who commented on the hijab being patriarchal were mostly non-Muslim male students. This may happened by mere chance, owing to the small number of people who responded; in fact there are many Muslims and Muslim women themselves who find the hijab to be patriarchal. But I pointed this out because it reminded me of something else I see all the time, as in how those who have never worn a hijab and have no lived experiences with it, especially men who claim to be progressive, frequently express their concern about Muslim women wearing them, stating that the latter are fooled into believing they have a choice and are too oppressed to recognise it. 

When a hijabi woman insists that wearing a hijab is her choice (she shouldn't have been put in the position of explaining her clothes in the first place), she is frequently told, either directly or indirectly, that "It is your conditioning that makes you believe it is a choice," or "Your idea of having a choice is delusional if you won’t remove it". But, if we were to examine the concepts of conditioning and choices a bit, we may come to the conclusion that most, if not all, of our choices are born out of different types of conditioning– personal, communal or generational. So, yes, the hijab, like other things, could be a result of conditioning for most of its wearers but how much of a problem is it really? By asking this, I don’t want to appear as if I'm attempting to normalize different forms of toxic or harmful conditioning and their damaging effects on people. But it is grating when 'progressive' people repeatedly call hijab a result of conditioning in a derogatory manner, almost denying the wearer's free will and agency. The efforts, in my opinion, should not be to force people to shed their conditioning, but rather to create safe spaces where each individual can make conscious decisions about whether or not they want to keep something that may be a product of conditioning, as long as it is not harming them or anyone else.

On 9th February 2022, Kalpa, the student media body of IISER Pune, hosted a gathering where some students and faculty stood in solidarity with the students of Karnataka and expressed their discontent with the curtaining of one's freedom to choose what to wear; the event received mixed reviews. There was a lot of hostility directed at the organizers and participants in the comment section of Kalpa's tweet about the same. The majority of those comments are along the lines of 'people in STEM, especially those from prestigious institutions like IISERS, should not bother with such political issues and focus solely on science'. Other hateful and insensitive remarks, particularly about the hijab, were also made.

But are people in STEM, especially students like us who are the nation’s future supposed to stay apolitical? Can one truly separate personal from the political? One can, only when one is privileged enough. Staying apolitical will always be a privilege, because only someone who is unaffected and unbothered by particular events can remain apolitical toward them. It is true that most of us at IISER are privileged enough to be unaffected by issues like the hijab ban, but imagine the people we would influence and the changes we could make if we acknowledged that privilege and did something to address such issues. Why should science students have to forego expressing their views and morals and continue doing science as beings devoid of human emotions? Do we all not need to have a collective conscience when it comes to injustices against fellow humans, and shouldn't doing science also be about everything that makes us human?

Before I conclude, I’d like to mention one of the responses we received for our questionnaire that almost seems to sum up this article, so, I'm quoting his words exactly as they are:
 >The Hijab ban is another misplaced attempt by men, Hindu men, of taking control of Muslim women’s bodies. There is something very sick about our society that views controlling women’s bodies as a powerful act. While the hijab is an attempt at controlling a woman's body by hiding her, the hijab ban does exactly the same by unclothing her. What is missing from this entire discourse is the voices of Muslim girls whose lives this affects the most. Is the hijab oppressive? Why not let the young Muslim women decide it for themselves? If this suggestion seems so radical to most of us then it is because in our country women are either deified or infantilized. Women are, for the most part, not considered to be human beings with agency, with a will to decide what they want and do not want for themselves. What is the role of an educational institution in this? Educational institutions, first and foremost, should create safe places for students to grow, to question their beliefs, and the society in which they live. The solution to the hijab ‘problem’ is also the same: create a safe place for the students to decide whether or not they want to wear a hijab. If a young woman is forced to wear a hijab by her parents, then an educational institution should create a space for her to feel free to take it off, without judgment and without repercussions. The same educational institution must also make sure that a girl who wants to wear the hijab can do so, again without judgment and repercussions. We have utterly failed in this regard and the hijab ban, rather than making educational institutions a safe place for students to grow, makes it more dangerous for Muslim women. The courts upheld the hijab ban citing that the hijab is not an essential religious practice. In my opinion, whether or not the hijab is an essential religious practice is completely irrelevant to this discussion. Nobody is debating whether or not the sacred thread worn by Hindu upper caste men is an essential religious practice. Then why should the same be done about hijabs? At the end of the day, this will lead to many more Muslim women dropping out of schools, whether or not they want to wear a hijab."

With that said, let us not assume that the hijab ban was a one-off incident. Or that the hijab ban was the only recent incident of discrimination against Muslim women. The issue at hand is much larger than a piece of clothing; let us not forget the daily discrimination, injustice, and oppression directed at Muslims. At the same time, let’s not forget all the women who are forced to wear hijabs or any other clothing. Let us all work towards a future where every individual, woman or not, gets to choose what to wear, without judgement, without discrimination and with comfort and confidence.
