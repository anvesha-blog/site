For any creator, whether of art or literature or YouTube channels, criticism is a huge part of improving the content in question. More often than not, we have seen successful content creators who remain calm and consider the feedback if it is constructive and if the critic’s intentions ar e honest. YouTube is one such important social platform where one could dislike particular content rather than just like it. 

Many budding creators get anxious about the dislike button: for a good reason–what if my video ends up getting just dislikes? What if other viewers get biased about my video by seeing the number of harsh dislikes? So how much *does* the dislike option add to the quality of the platform? What advantage does it offer compared to other platforms without such a feedback button? 

Analyzing the number of likes and dislikes for the different types of content one puts out can help identify which content the viewers find most engaging. This helps each creator focus on the type of content they’re best at or improve the skills they need to make their videos more interesting. This is common to anyone taking constructive criticism positively: negative feedback can be helpful to correct mistakes. This is also true of a creator with a loyal viewership–a regular viewer may not necessarily like all your videos, they may dislike the video too, the difference from an irregular viewer being that the regular one would more likely explain why in the comments. 

The YouTube algorithm is designed to emphasize the importance of the ‘activity’ of the user, whether it be positive or negative. This means that if a viewer hits the thumbs down button only after watching the entire video, the algorithm considers the video worthy of attention based on the watch time, which is not that much of a bummer. (Albeit, one shouldn’t rule out the possibility that the viewer watched with one last hope that it would get better.) In fact, some of the most disliked videos also end up getting the most views because of how the number of dislikes increases engagement levels.

Another use of the dislike button is so that the algorithm can tailor the recommendations for each user accordingly. In this sense, the dislike button is a bummer for the creator. 

It was in the middle of all this that YouTube released “an update to dislikes on YouTube”--the dislike button would remain, but the dislike count would be private. The transition to this update was confirmed in early 2021 after YouTube experimented with the dislike button. What if a viewer ends up getting biased about the video after seeing the number of dislikes it already has? In an effort to reduce dislike attacks–where viewers would drive up the number of dislikes on a video. *“I want to know who’s disliking my videos” “Whenever I upload a video, it immediately gets disliked from one of my competitors.” “I want to know whether so-and-so dislikes my videos.”* are a few of many angry comments from creators that YouTube had got. YouTube made changes to the dislike button and studied the results. 

“But because the count was not visible to them, we found that they were less likely to target a video’s dislike button to drive up the count. In short, our experiment data showed a reduction in dislike attacking behavior”, says the update statement on a YouTube blog. 

This is a win-win situation for both creators and viewers. Users can still dislike videos and thus can still tune the recommendations they get; creators will still be able to find the dislike count at YouTube Studios if they’d like to know how their videos are performing. It is a blessing for smaller or new creators who were especially vulnerable to dislike attacks. 

YouTube stated: “This is just one of many steps we are taking to continue to protect creators from harassment. Our work is not done, and we’ll continue to invest here.” 

However, the change has been met with widespread criticism from a plethora of viewers and smaller creators. Many stated the importance of being able to see the ratio of likes and dislikes to judge whether a video is worth their time or not. Others opined that this illustrates YouTube’s bias towards mega-corporations over smaller independent creators seeing how it would reduce their engagement rates, as previously discussed. Many even suggested collectively abandoning the platform but also had to face the truth of YouTube being the most commonly used and largest platform as of now. 

Some have even questioned whether or not YouTube made the move because the most-disliked video ever on the platform happens to be one of their own. In early 2021, “YouTube Rewind 2018” had over 19 million dislikes, compared with three million likes. Though YouTube has not confirmed this, many users continue to develop similar theories even as the change has slowly become permanent across the entire platform–an inevitable deal with it.
