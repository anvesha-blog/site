The title of this article is borrowed from the title of a classic  mathematical text by Richard Courant and Herbert Robbins. The  motivation behind this article stems from my search to understand what  math is all about, a search which was helped by a lot of books,  interactions with friends and more introspection into this very basic  question. Thus, this article is an exposition into what math is all about,  how we can use it and what it teaches us, apart from giving short notes  on problem solving. 

“The Book of Nature is written in the language of Mathematics”

The above mentioned quote of Galileo sets the record straight  away, in terms of what this article has to offer. Whenever we begin a  search about something, the first thing that comes up is, how did that  particular thing originate? So, it is very natural to ask if mathematics  was a discovery or an invention. Actually, it is a bit of both. One of the  basic and the very first things in math that one encounters is numbers. The idea of natural numbers is very natural, which it is aptly conveyed  by its name. Human beings wanted to quantify the things that they see and that gave rise to these counting numbers. Most of these primitive ideas were  readily available in nature and humans interpreted it in their own way to  understand it and use it in a better way. Then, nature was happy to let  the people develop this language using their curiosity, even as it continues to inspire mankind in search of new things. Curiosity and the art  of questioning are the fundamental things that lead to the further  evolution of math. Therefore the first lesson for doing math is to  be curious and ask questions until an answer that convinces oneself, is found. 

As the caption to the title suggests, mathematics is a language,  whose alphabets are the numbers and symbols. The main pillar of  mathematics is logic, which basically arose out of people's common sense  in understanding and explaining things in the best possible way. As it  happens with every language, the language of mathematics too has its  own grammar. Mathematical statements and quantifiers form the basis  of its grammar. An example of a statement is 1+0=1. Mathematics  always revolves around statements. The objective is to decide whether a  statement is true/false. That leads to the idea of proofs. Almost all the  statements are not accepted/assumed without concrete proof. Therein lies the beauty of mathematics. Why is it mentioned “almost all”? Yes, there  are a few statements called axioms – which do not need a proof. To  illustrate with an example, let us consider this question. Why should 6  come after 5? Why should 7 be greater than 2? Such questions will lead  to total chaos and this clearly emphasizes the need for a common  convention, upon which the whole structure is built on. Thus, there is a  fine line between just making some assumptions and accepting things as  axioms.

There is a side of mathematics which makes things simpler to  people in the form of pictures. Geometric ideas and visualization are very crucial aspects of this language. On the other hand there is a side of  this language which is very abstract, with certain things being hard to  relate to physical entities. There, our intuition and the ability to  understand the motivation behind these beautiful concepts will help. In my opinion, it is because of this way in which math balances both visual and abstract  mediums that makes mathematics shine as the brightest star in the vast  constellation of languages and sciences.  

Now let us look at some things that mathematics teaches us. This language teaches the art of problem solving. Certain problems may look  very complicated at the first glance, but they could be easily tackled by  breaking them into much smaller problems or using already existing  ones. Thus, be it problem solving in math or in real life, it is good to  break a bigger problem into smaller parts, solve those smaller ones, then  get back the solution to the bigger problem by integrating the solutions  of the smaller ones. Mathematics teaches us to be patient. The joy experienced after getting a  solution after a huge amount of effort is something that is beyond words. One more lesson taught to us by mathematical  research is the never ending quest for studying a particular field. Though  it may appear that there is almost negligible growth possible in a  particular field, the urge to simplify things will definitely make  people continue to work in that area. Old results get refined in the process. This  also emphasizes the fact that, be it in life or math, even after a big success, there is always room for improvement. Another astonishing  feature of mathematics is the seemingly unrelated connections that exist  between two areas that appear to be polar opposites of each other. One such example is the use of the concept of prime numbers in protecting the Debit and credit cards that we use, which has forged a nice partnership between Number theory and cryptography. There was a time when mathematicians were wondering if prime numbers have any practical application at all. The modern day mathematicians, with the help of technology, have provided an answer for this. Mathematics is timeless and  there are many discoveries that are found to be applied  in completely unrelated domains, that too hundreds of years after the discovery. A classic example is Ramanujan’s Mock modular forms,  which are used in studying black holes. One must note that the term  'black hole' wasn’t even coined when Ramanujan defined this function.

Now, let us proceed to think about what we can do to utilize the  benefits offered by math and give an insight into problem solving.  Whenever one sees a result, one should go into the shoes of the person  who first proved it. This way of learning will help us understand the  concept better and also gives one a feeling of “discovering” the proof. It  is always good to know the history and motivation behind the result.  Whenever we see a problem, it is very important to understand the given  conditions, think about how to use them in solving them. While solving, one can think of analogies – both mathematical and real life ones, to make  the problem simpler. The mathematical process doesn't simply stop after the problem is solved. One needs to think about if dropping some initial conditions could still solve the problem, or what will happen if some restrictions are added. In fact, some great problems are born out of this twisting the hypothesis idea . Fermat’s last theorem is a kind of generalization of the Pythagoras Theorem, which is one of the basic theorems in Geometry.  Once a problem is solved for some particular cases, the aim should always  be to break the barriers, go beyond the domains and generalize the  result.  
Math stands the test of time. Some results take not decades, but  centuries to solve. Fermat’s last theorem, mentioned above, is a classic example. This is one  result that gave rise to many new branches of math. Also, there are  results that have deep impressions on other branches of the subject once  they are proved. The concepts that make up a proof are not ideas that are very easy to come up with and hence involves years of hard work and dedication. Also, in  some cases, giving counterexamples helps – even though it is hard to  find one. But the effort one puts into finding it doesn’t go as a waste.  

Math is a universal language on which the day to day activities  depend and hence it is a friendly tool  for all of us. As long as there is life on this Earth and  there is human curiosity, math will exist and the art of questioning will  make sure that the subject will continue to evolve and provide a  sustainable growth of the language. It would be fitting to end this  exposition with a verse from the centuries old Thamizh treatise  Thirukkural, 
“ எண்ணென்ப ஏனை எழுத்தென்ப இவ்விரண்டும் 
கண்ணென்ப வாழும் உயிர்க்கு” 
which translates to “Numbers and letters are like two eyes of  mankind”. It is a fair estimate to interpret the term “numbers” as  mathematics itself, as in those days, math was built on the foundations  of numbers. This article started with numbers being the alphabets  (letters) in the language of math. Hence, the bottom line of this article is  clearly drawn, inspired by this Thirukkural. Mathematics is the eye  using which humans see this world and beyond.
