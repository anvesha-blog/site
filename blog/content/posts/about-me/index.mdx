Greetings! Welcome to Anvesha, the official science club of [IISER Thiruvananthapuram](http://www.iisertvm.ac.in/). In research institutes such as IISER, it is paramount to have a platform where a free exchange of ideas is possible; a platform that delves into the depths of the scientific method. Thus, the Anvesha blog was created!

We also have a monthly science newsletter called ['Exhibit: A'](/codestats/) where we bring to you the latest in science!
Our goal has always been to make these platforms as collaborative as possible; we would love to share your content! Send your submissions to [anveshacontent@gmail.com](mailto:anveshacontent@gmail.com) (external submissions are more than welcome.)

So, what are you waiting for?

### Balaram Vishnu Subramani
#### Editor-in-Chief, Batch '17

A small town boy from Vellore and shampoo connoisseur, Vishnu grows out his hair just to avoid eye-contact with people.

He loves sharing and exploring different musical styles, and often dabbles in song-writing as a guitarist/vocalist; there's a 100% chance he’s going to judge your music taste and make you a custom playlist before he bothers to learn your name. When he’s not headbanging to Led Zeppelin’s ungodly jams, he’s most probably attending a protest or pursuing his hedonistic dreams. His talent in FPS games as Mr.Bayangrasamy has earned him quite a notorious title in IISER and neighbouring colleges. He likes to live his life by a quote from his favourite comedian, John Cleese, who said, “You do realise as you grow older that almost nobody knows what they are talking about.” After graduating, Vishnu would like to pursue a PhD in mathematical biology and further explore science journalism.
