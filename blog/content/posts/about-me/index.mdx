Greetings! Welcome to Anvesha, the official science club of [IISER Thiruvananthapuram](http://www.iisertvm.ac.in/). In research institutes such as IISER, it is paramount to have a platform where a free exchange of ideas is possible; a platform that delves into the depths of the scientific method. Thus, the Anvesha blog was created!

We also have a monthly science newsletter called ['Exhibit: A'](/codestats/) where we bring to you the latest in science!
Our goal has always been to make these platforms as collaborative as possible; we would love to share your content! Send your submissions to [anveshacontent@gmail.com](mailto:anveshacontent@gmail.com) (external submissions are more than welcome.)

So, what are you waiting for?

<p>
<br />
A small town boy from Vellore and shampoo connoisseur, Vishnu grows out his hair just to avoid eye-contact with people.
<details>
<summary style="color: gray;"> Read more </summary>
He loves sharing and exploring different musical styles, and often dabbles in song-writing as a guitarist/vocalist; there's a 100% chance he’s going to judge your music taste and make you a custom playlist before he bothers to learn your name. When he’s not headbanging to Led Zeppelin’s ungodly jams, he’s most probably attending a protest or pursuing his hedonistic dreams. His talent in FPS games as Mr.Bayangrasamy has earned him quite a notorious title in IISER and neighbouring colleges. He likes to live his life by a quote from his favourite comedian, John Cleese, who said, “You do realise as you grow older that almost nobody knows what they are talking about.” After graduating, Vishnu would like to pursue a PhD in mathematical biology and further explore science journalism.

### Yashas Ramakrishna
#### Editor, Batch '16

<p>
<br />
He’s your everyday introvert, quite affable, but super comfortable by himself.
<details>
<summary style="color: gray;"> Read more </summary>
When he’s not binging on books (digs dystopian, horror, sci-fi and thriller), movies, TV shows or anime, he wanders off into his fantasy realm, pulling out stories which he pens often. He currently spends his free time playing and experimenting with paint, learning to play the keyboard and to code. What he does otherwise is explore and learn new topics that better his understanding towards his goal of delving into evolutionary developmental neuroscience and neuroregenerative medicine. If you want to single him out, find a person who checks all of the below – walks like Fred from Scooby Doo, punctuates each text, is obsessed with small particulars, sleeps in a single position and wears a beanie in all seasons.

### Akshita Mittal
#### Content Creator, Batch '19

<p>
<br />
A proud Punjabi, Akshita has an entire list of quirky habits: reading plots before watching shows, brushing teeth with the non-dominant hand, and humming self-made and often displeasing tunes while studying.
<details>
<summary style="color: gray;"> Read more </summary>
Much to her friends' annoyance, she relishes making bad jokes and laughing at them until she turns red. Here's a guide to getting on her nerves: Honking, buttinskies, half-assing, tartuffes, token supporting and lip service, 'coaching culture', fashion trends and spam mails.
She  enjoys reading surreal fiction, fastidiously tidying and organising, spending hours admiring powerful women, and breaking her head over puzzles. Something that recently brought her joy was finding new sustainable methods to adopt, and listening to Noise Making by Hozier.

<details>
<summary style="color: gray;"> Read more </summary>
He enjoys football, video games and competitive sleeping. His research interests include high energy and gravitational physics, not that he knows much about them though.The Eragon series by Christopher Paolini really caught his imagination. Other great books he loves are the 'Three Body Problem' and 'Chaos'. Instrumental music, like Rain by Simply Three, really brings the calm to his chaos. Character sketch: Not very amiable, rude without meaning to be and manages to get on the bad side of every professor he meets for more than 45 minutes.

### Gokul Prabhu
#### Content Creator, Batch '17

<p>
<br />
At school, Gokul was that kid that seemed never to be paying attention; lost in his own thoughts and ideas.
<details>
<summary style="color: gray;"> Read more </summary>
He’s  had insanely crazy ideas ever since he was in diapers. Things never change, though he’s no longer in diapers now. Currently, he’s brainstorming ideas to help understand flora and fauna better. Volunteering for Zooniverse and Smithsonian, listening to podcasts while sipping some filter coffee are his  favourite ways of spending time. 
He enjoys talking to interesting people and hence ended up having more boomer friends than millennial friends. In his downtime, he relishes one-sided conversations with my friends Ellen and Casey. Sometimes, he opens up Uber and watches the cars move around, that’s when Hozier sings to him. His post-retirement plans include disappearing into a thick rainforest or a tropical island and listening to some good ol’ Jazz.
