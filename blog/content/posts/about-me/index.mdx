Greetings! Welcome to Anvesha, the official science club of [IISER Thiruvananthapuram](http://www.iisertvm.ac.in/). In research institutes such as IISER, it is paramount to have a platform where a free exchange of ideas is possible; a platform that delves into the depths of the scientific method. Thus, the Anvesha blog was created!

We also have a monthly science newsletter called ['Exhibit: A'](/codestats/) where we bring to you the latest in science!
Our goal has always been to make these platforms as collaborative as possible; we would love to share your content! Send your submissions to [anveshacontent@gmail.com](mailto:anveshacontent@gmail.com) (external submissions are more than welcome.)

So, what are you waiting for?
