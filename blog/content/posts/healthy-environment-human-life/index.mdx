The UN Environment Programme annually organizes events for World
Environment Day, which encourages worldwide awareness and action for the
protection of our abode. It is celebrated on 5 June in over 100
countries. This year, 2019, China will host the global World Environment
Day celebrations on the theme, 'Air Pollution'. But a healthy planet
depends on all of us.

The most important environmental problem that we're facing today is
humanity's irrational and unsustainable over-exploitation of natural
resources. We have come to believe that, with the aid of technology, we
can free ourselves of the limits which nature imposes on us. Taking our
surroundings for granted has brought us to a point of no return. The
darkest hour has come and it is time to fight and restore whatever is
left of our mother nature.

Approximately 7 million people worldwide die prematurely each year from
air pollution, with about 4 million of these deaths occurring in
Asia-Pacific. 1.2 million deaths every year due to outdoor air pollution in India. 3% of our GDP is lost due to air pollution.

We don't talk much about air pollution but we should, because the air we
breathe is slowly killing us. The quality of the air we breathe depends
on the lifestyle choices we make every day.

On the bright side, there are multiple leaders coming forth with great
ideas to save the world. Sadiq Khan, mayor of London has pushed for an ultra-low emissions zone. Chile has the second largest electric bus fleet in the world, after
China. Costa Rica, uses a combination of solar, biomass, wind and geothermal
energy to cover the country's energy needs for over 300 days a year. It
has a long-term plan to de-carbonize its economy which includes electric
mobility. India is not falling behind as well, in the gold rush for global
domination, we too have put our hats in the rings for electric mobility.

Understanding the different types of pollution and how it affects our
health and environment will help us take steps towards its improvement. Transport emissions is amongst the significant contributors in air
pollution. We need to avoid the need for transport, and shift to more
efficient modes and improve transport.

Air pollution from agriculture is majorly contributed by livestock and
burning agricultural waste. Moving to a plant based diet and reducing
food waste can significantly help in this arena.

Indoor burning of fossil fuels is a major threat. A need to shift to
cleaner and modern stoves can reduce the risk of illness and save lives.

As the global movement to tackle air pollution gathers pace, innovators
are rising to the challenge, unveiling products and technologies that
remove some of the dangerous toxins that are seeping into our lungs and
accelerating climate change. I urge you to tinker your thinking hats and
look for changes which we can make .We would love to hear from you.

World Environment Day 2019 will urge governments, industry, communities,
and individuals to come together to explore renewable energy and green
technologies, and improve air quality in cities and regions across the
world. However, we should recognize the priceless value of the ecosystem
services provided to us by our own biodiversity, and we shall recover
the respect for nature which is indispensable if humans are to
rediscover our safe place ; our rightful planet.
