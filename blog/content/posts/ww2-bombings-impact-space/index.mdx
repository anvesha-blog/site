Chris Scott, Professor of Space and Atmospheric Physics, said: "The
images of neighbourhoods across Europe reduced to rubble due to wartime
air raids are a lasting reminder of the destruction that can be caused
by human-made explosions. But the impact of these bombs way up in the
Earth's atmosphere has never been realized until now."

The effect of human activities on the composition of the atmosphere has
long been extensively studied-release of chlorofluorocarbons and
increased CO2 levels. However, a recent study by the researchers at The
University of Reading showed that the ionosphere can be affected by
events that occur on the earth's surface.

After looking at the daily records at the Radio Research Centre in
Slough, UK, collected between 1943-45, it was found that the height and
electron concentration of the ionosphere was far more variable than
expected by the current standing model. This implied that there were
other events that influenced it.

The ionosphere is a region that includes the thermosphere, parts of the
mesosphere and exosphere and is a prerequisite for long-range radio
transmission. It itself is divided into layers- D,E and F, with F being
the outermost one.

When the ionosphere was studied around the time of the 152 large air
raids in Europe, it was found that the electron concentration was
significantly decreased due to the shock-waves released by the
explosions.

Each raid released energy equivalent to 300 lightning strikes. This
opens discussions on various consequences of events on the surface like
volcanic eruptions, lightning and earthquakes on the earth's upper
atmosphere.

For instance, since lightning strikes have distinct diurnal and seasonal
cycles, this research could explain the seasonal anomaly in ionospheric
F-region electron concentrations.

The scientists also aim to determine the minimum explosive energy
required to create a disturbance in the upper atmosphere.

"The unprecedented power of these attacks has proved useful for
scientists to gauge the impact such events can have hundreds of
kilometers above the Earth, in addition to the devastation they caused
on the ground.", said Professor Patrick Major, University of Reading
historian and a co-author of the study.
