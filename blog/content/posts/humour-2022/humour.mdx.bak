The other day I was talking to a friend and I made a self-deprecating joke, earnestly waiting for their laughter. To my utter annoyance, I was greeted with a lecture on how I should appreciate myself more instead. I countered that only the most confident people can make themselves the butt of the joke. But it got me thinking, is self-deprecating humour a mark of confidence or insecurity?

Researchers from Charles Sturt University conducted a study titled [Differential effects of self-esteem and interpersonal competence on humor styles](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23180973/) using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory, the Interpersonal Competence Questionnaire, and the Humor Styles Questionnaire. The relationships between humor styles, interpersonal competence, and self-esteem showed a mixture of patterns. However, greater use of affiliative humour emerged from high self-esteem and high interpersonal competence. Use of aggressive humour emerged independently from high self-esteem and low interpersonal competence. The results of this study showed that self-deprecating humour styles were less associated with individuals having high self esteem. They leaned to a more affiliative, aggressive, and self-enhancing humor styles. This study is however limited since individuals are accommodative of the humour style of the person they are conversing with. This dynamic ability leads to a much more complex set of relations between the individual and their own humour style.

There is an interesting relationship between humour and the workplace. Leadership roles require a delicate bond. Using self-deprecating humour can blur the status difference between the leader and the follower. A ‘it’s not you, it’s me’  type of humour can win you brownie points and rate you higher on the individualized consideration scale (to a certain extent, of course, be wary of being labelled incompetent). Research is ongoing in the role of humour in the workplace.

Another core facet is  “Laughing At Yourself” (LAY) humour. [Sense of Humor Scale (SHS/McGhee)](http://www.humorstudies.org/ISHS%20Test%20Bank/TestCat_SHSmcghee.htm) was used to measure the ability of participants to LAY. This is the ability to accept weaknesses, to laugh when embarrassed or put in awkward situations without disparaging oneself. This requires a high degree of self acceptance and perspective to look at the funny side of things. The results showed that LAY has a continuum ranging from “not feeling negatively about being the target of a joke” to “hearty laughter”. It can lessen the blow and diffuse criticism even if one falls in the first spectrum of the scale. It may be harder to achieve a state of hearty laughter. Participants who accepted their weaknesses and blunders could step away from the initial negative feeling and lighten up about the situation. 

Self-deprecating humour can be used as a coping mechanism that could reduce anxiety about yourself or the situation at hand. However, it shouldn’t come to a point where you believe the punchlines to be your reality. The takeaway is that balance is key. Just like different movie genres are received differently by different people, dark humour may not be everyone’s cup of tea. Read your audience before attempting a self-deprecating joke or you may end up in an awkward position.
